        <h2>Solar Eclipse</h2>
        <p>A solar eclipse is a phenomenon that occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun’s light from reaching the Earth. Depending on the relative positions and distances of the three bodies, there are different types of solar eclipses. A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon completely covers the Sun’s disk, creating a dark shadow on a small area of the Earth. A partial solar eclipse happens when the Moon only partially covers the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped shadow on a larger area of the Earth. An annular solar eclipse happens when the Moon is farther from the Earth and appears smaller than the Sun, creating a bright ring around the Moon’s silhouette. A hybrid solar eclipse happens when the eclipse changes from annular to total or vice versa along its path. Solar eclipses are rare and spectacular events that can only be seen from certain locations and at certain times.
