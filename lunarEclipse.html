        <h2>Lunar Eclipse</h2>
        <p>A lunar eclipse is a phenomenon that occurs when the Moon passes into the Earth’s shadow, blocking some or all of the sunlight from reaching it. This can only happen during a full moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned. There are different types of lunar eclipses, depending on how much of the Moon is covered by the Earth’s shadow. A total lunar eclipse happens when the entire Moon is in the darkest part of the shadow, called the umbra. The Moon turns a reddish color because of the sunlight that is refracted by the Earth’s atmosphere. A partial lunar eclipse happens when only part of the Moon is in the umbra, and the rest is in the lighter part of the shadow, called the penumbra. The Moon appears to have a dark bite taken out of it. A penumbral lunar eclipse happens when the Moon is only in the penumbra, and the dimming is very subtle. Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on the night side of the Earth, and they last for a few hours.
